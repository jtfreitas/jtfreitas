Greetings, traveller!

I'm @jtfreitas and you have reached my profile. Welcome!

You will generally find me automating quantitative tasks. These can range from web scraping the times xkcd is brought up on reddit to building data pipelines that feed into ML models.

I procrastinate by spending time on CERN Open Data Portal, making my own attempts at Kaggle problems, or trying out custom ROMs on my android phone.

When it's time to get serious, I wield Python and R as my sword and shield, but at the height of the battle, Fortran95 and C++ cavalry always have my back.

While we do depend on data science to do better physics, I also try to focus on how to use physics to do better data science.
