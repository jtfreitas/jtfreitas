Greetings, traveller!

I'm @jtfreitas and you have reached my profile. Welcome!

You will generally find me automating quantitative tasks. These can range from web scraping the times xkcd is brought up on reddit to building data pipelines that feed into ML models.

I procrastinate by spending time on CERN Open Data Portal, making my own attempts at Kaggle problems, or trying out custom ROMs on my android phone.

When it's time to get serious, I wield Python and R as my sword and shield, but at the height of the battle, Fortran95 and C++ cavalry always have my back.

Trying to use data science for better physics, and to use physics for better data science.
